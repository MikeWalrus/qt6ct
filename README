qt6ct - Qt6 Configuration Tool

This program allows users to configure Qt6 settings (theme, font, icons, etc.)
under DE/WM without Qt integration.

Official home page: https://github.com/trialuser02/qt6ct

Requirements:

- GNU Linux or FreeBSD
- qtbase >= 6.0.0
- qtsvg >= 6.0.0 (Runtime dependency for the SVG icon support)
- qttools >= 6.0.0 (For build only)


Installation:

qmake PREFIX=<your installation path>
make
make install (under root)

Add line 'export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt6ct' to ~/.profile and re-login.
Alternatively, create the file /etc/X11/Xsession.d/100-qt6ct with
the following line:

export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt6ct

(or qt5ct for compatibility)

Now restart X11 server to take the changes effect.

Extra build options (for advanced users only):
qmake DISABLE_WIDGETS=1 - compiles platform plugin without QtWidgets (useful for QML applications only)
qmake DISABLE_DBUS=1 - disable D-Bus support (global menu and D-Bus tray icon implementation)
qmake PLUGINDIR=<custom path> - changes the default installation path of the plugins (libqt6ct.so and libqt6ct-style.so)

Wayland:

If you are running Qt application under Wayland, you should export the following variables:

export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland
export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt6ct

Debug Messages:

By default, debug messages from platform plugin are disabled. To enable them, you should
export the following environment variable:

export QT_LOGGING_RULES="qt6ct.debug=true"

Another way is to change qtlogging.ini file. See Qt documentation for details:
https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qloggingcategory.html (paragraph "Configuring Categories")
